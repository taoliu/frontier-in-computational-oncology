# Spatial Omics of the Tumor Microenvironment

## Module overview

This module should tell a clear methodological story: dissociated single-cell atlases explain *who* is present in tumors, but spatial omics is needed to explain *where* cells, states, and signals are organized, and how that organization shapes invasion, immune exclusion, stromal barriers, hypoxia, and therapy response. Compared with dissociated single-cell assays, spatial molecular profiling introduces new computational problems tied to assay physics and geometry: mixed spots in sequencing-based assays, sparse molecule counts at very high resolution, cell segmentation and transcript-to-cell assignment in imaging assays, registration across serial sections, reference-based deconvolution, spatial statistics, neighborhood and niche detection, and cell-cell communication constrained by distance and tissue architecture. Across transcriptomics, proteomics, and emerging spatial epigenomics, the main teaching goal is not tool operation but model design: which assumptions are imposed by each assay, how those assumptions enter algorithms, and how one can verify that inferred spatial biology is real rather than an artifact of resolution, panel design, segmentation, or reference mismatch. citeturn22view4turn22view1turn5search1turn38search0turn11search20

DOI: 10.1016/j.ccell.2023.01.010.** A strong entry-point review for the oncology framing of spatial technologies, what types of biological questions they answer, and where the field was heading in cancer by 2023. citeturn22view4

## Initial triage

- Strongest sections: strong methodological framing that spatial omics complements dissociated single-cell atlases by adding tissue geometry; clear separation of sequencing-based, imaging-based, proteomic, and emerging spatial epigenomic regimes; useful emphasis on deconvolution, segmentation, niche/domain detection, spatial statistics, cell-cell communication, registration, and benchmark instability.
- Weak or missing areas: citation markers are ChatGPT Deep Research internal turn references and are not usable as final citations; several fast-moving platform/resource claims need current verification, especially 2025 imaging benchmarks, HTAN release counts, Visium HD case studies, and spatial epigenomics claims.
- Claims requiring validation: all must-read papers/resources and DOIs; benchmark sizes and platform comparisons; HTAN counts and assay list; tumor case-study details; claims about best-performing methods in deconvolution/domain/registration benchmarks; boundaries versus Week 3 single-cell and Week 9 pathology imaging.
- Suggested source-priority level: high — this is a core spatial module with many platform-specific and fast-moving claims that should be validated before lecture-plan generation.
